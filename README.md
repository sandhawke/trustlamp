This repo is for doing project management for TrustLamp.   Bugs, feature request, milestones, etc, go here.

Why?  Because we're keeping the source code private until we've had sufficient review of social impact.  So, 
this way, we can make this repo public before the source code. (Also, the code is in a few different repos 
at the moment.)
